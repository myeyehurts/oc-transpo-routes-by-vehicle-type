# oc-transpo-routes-by-vehicle-type
Work in progress: this will be a tool that allows the user to select an OC Transpo route and see the percentage of trips in the past 24 hours divided by vehicle type (ex: double decker, accordion bus, yes that is the scientific name, etc). Stop sending tiny buses on the 90 Greenboro at rush hour!!!!!!!!!!
